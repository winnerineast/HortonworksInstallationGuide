# HortonworksInstallationGuide
## background
### I were assigned to design a big data systems in multiple servers, so I decided to test my design in my two laptop first with hortonworks data platform.

## Environment
- one Macbook Pro (CPU i7,Memory 16GB, MacOS Sierra), abbr. MBP
- one Surface Pro3(CPU i5,Memory 8GB, Windows 8.1), abbr. SP3

## Big Data System Deployment Goal
- Phase1: setup Hortonworks HDP sandbox in both MBP and SP3 and the user could access them from either MBP or SP3 in both hosts and VMs.
- Phase2: configure MBP as Ambari master and SP3 as slave and the user could access them from either MBP or SP3 in both hosts and VMs.
- Phase3: shift invidvidual components between MBP and SP3 and the user could access them from either MBP or SP3 in both hosts and VMs.
- Phase4: shift all deployments into Docker.
